This is the ADMS-7 software from Yaesu, decompiled and edited to run on Linux.
I disabled the throwing of exceptions in part of the DataConverter class to stop errors on read.
I changed file paths to use the Unix path separator instead of the DOS one.
Build by running "msbuild" inside the Ftm400dAdms7 folder.
Run by running "mono Ftm400dAdms7.exe" in this folder.
